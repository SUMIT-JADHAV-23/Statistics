To find the probability of getting a sum at most 9 when rolling a pair of six-sided dice, 
we can consider all the possible combinations of outcomes.
The total number of outcomes is 6Ã—6=36(since each die has 6 faces).
Now, let's list the combinations where the sum is at most 9:
Sum = 2: (1, 1)
Sum = 3: (1, 2), (2, 1)
Sum = 4: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Sum = 5: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Sum = 6: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Sum = 7: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)
Sum = 8: (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2)
Sum = 9: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3)
There are 30 favorable outcomes (combinations with sums at most 9). Therefore, the probability is given by:
P(Sum at most 9)=Number of favorable outcomes/Total number of outcomes=30/36=5/6
